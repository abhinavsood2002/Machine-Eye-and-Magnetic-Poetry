# MachineEye
This repository contains the code regarding the development of the Machine Eye system. The multiple components
in the machine system are recorded in various branches of this repository. The current braches implementation related
branches in the repository are as follows:

**Machine Eye Related**
- **rpi** : This branch contains the code that is run on a Raspberry Pi (Model 4B).
- **server** : This branch contains the implementation of the the remote server that stores and processes information collected on the raspberry pi.

**Magnetic Poetry Related**
- **poetry-rpi** : This branch contains the code that is run on a Raspberry Pi (Model 4B). 
- **poetry-server** : This branch contains the implementation of the the remote server that stores and processes information collected on the raspberry pi.
